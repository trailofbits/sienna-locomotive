<p>As the use of software to control more of the world inexorably increases, so does the importance of having confidence that software cannot easily be subverted by attackers. To provide this assurance, several techniques have been developed. One of the most effective and low-cost is software fuzzing, which randomly and semi-randomly permutes software inputs (e.g. files or network data). The software being tested is monitored for indicators of poor code quality and security vulnerabilities, such as crashes.</p>

<p>Fuzzing is a very effective technique; however, it is frequently too effective. Fuzzing generally produces hundreds or thousands of crashes, each a candidate software vulnerability that must be mitigated. Many of the crashes will have the same root cause but initially appear to be unique issues. When addressing the results of a fuzzing campaign, three concerns are certain to emerge:
<ul>
<li>Which of the crashes identified have the same fundamental cause?</li>
<li>For a given fundamental cause, what is the minimum input that triggers the crashing condition?</li>
<li>Which of the crashes identified is the most serious?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>These concerns are important because categorization of similar crashes can motivate both the fuzzing campaign itself as well as the remediation efforts following. The severity of each crash is a valuable metric to helps prioritize limited remediation resources.</p>

<p>The goals of the first phase of Sienna Locomotive are two-fold: survey existing state-of-the-art in exploitability detection and develop a prototype application that pushes that state via techniques such as concolic execution and taint tracking.</p>
