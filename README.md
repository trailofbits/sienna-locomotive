# Sienna Locomotive 2

## Getting started
- `fuzzkit` is a set of experiements using Windows debugging API for process injection, function hooking, fuzzing, tracing, and crash triage.
- `triage_pin` contains the pin based prototype of our crash triage tool.
- `electriage` contains the Electron + React front end to the pin prototype.
