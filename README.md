# Sienna Locomotive 2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/trailofbits/sienna-locomotive.svg?token=DQQpqJG5gna6rypMg4Lk&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/trailofbits/sienna-locomotive)

Sienna Locomotive is a integrated fuzzing and crash triage platform with usability features
that are intended to attract a wider user base than conventional fuzzing tools.

Sienna Locomotive's primary goal is to bring all the power that software fuzzing has to offer into
the hands of less-experienced users. Of course, focusing on ease of use won't stop us from trying
to make it smarter and faster than the competition.

## Getting Started

Read this [blog post]().

Watch this [demo video]().

Check out the [user manual](./_assets/manual.pdf).

### High level architecture

### Installation

**IMPORTANT**: Sienna Locomotive 2 makes changes to the system it runs on in order to
facilitate its instrumentation. It will run best when installed on its own machine (including
virtual machines).

Pre-built binaries are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/trailofbits/sienna-locomotive/releases).

To build Sienna Locomotive for yourself, continue reading.

### Building
First, clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/sienna-locomotive.git` (or download a zip)

#### Dependencies

Building SL2 requires the following:

* Windows 10, release 1803
    * Earlier versions of Windows 10 will probably work, 1809 support is pending.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Visual Studio 2017 (Install components for Windows Console dev)
* DynamoRIO (Automatically installed with `make.ps1`)
* Python (3.7+)

#### Build Commands

Compilation, deployment, and cleanup is done via `make.ps1` in Sienna Locomotive's
root directory.

To install DynamoRIO and build the project:

`PS C:\proj\sl2\sienna-locomotive> .\make.ps1`

If any part of the build complains about missing tools or libraries, try running under
the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.

To clean the project of build artifacts, run `.\make.ps1 clean`.

Try `make.ps1 help` for more options and information.

#### Internal API Documentation

SL2's internals are documented using Doxygen.

If you want to build the doxygen documents.
  1. Install doxygen from http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/doxygen-1.8.14-setup.exe
  1. `./make.ps1 doc`
  1. Open `doc/html/index.html` in your browser

### Running

#### Via the GUI

Running `sl2` will start the Qt frontend for the fuzzer.

This frontend is the default user interface, and should suffice for most use cases.

#### Via the CLI

For more advanced users, `sl2-cli` can be used to configure and run each SL2 component individually.

`sl2-cli -h` will print out a listing of all available options.

#### To run individual components manually

**NOTE**: Normal users can ignore this information.

From the root of the project:

```
# General Pattern:
.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c build\client_name\Debug\client.dll [client_args] -- C:\path\to\target_application [target_args]

# triage
.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c build\tracer\Debug\tracer.dll -- corpus\win_asm\crashes.exe 7

# wizard
.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c build\wizard\Debug\wizard.dll -- build\corpus\test_application\Debug\test_application.exe 0

# server
build\server\Debug\server.exe

# fuzzer
.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c build\fuzzer\Debug\fuzzer.dll -- build\corpus\test_application\Debug\test_application.exe 0 -f

# triage crash
.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c sienna-locomotive\build\tracer\Debug\tracer.dll -r [RUN_ID] -- build\corpus\test_application\Debug\test_application.exe 0 -f

# targeting
.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c build\fuzzer\Debug\fuzzer.dll -t 0,ReadFile -- build\corpus\test_application\Debug\test_application.exe 0 -f

.\dynamorio\bin64\drrun.exe -c build\tracer\Debug\tracer.dll -r [RUN_ID] -t 0,ReadFile -- build\corpus\test_application\Debug\test_application.exe 0 -f
```

#### Regression Test

`sl2-test` runs the SL2 regression tests.

You can also run the tests directly via `python sl2/test/__main__.py`.

## Triage

The triage system is a separate executable, `triager.exe` that is run by the harness.  It takes care of ranking exploitability, uniqueness, and binning of crashes.

### Winchecksec

Read the [winchecksec README](https://github.com/trailofbits/winchecksec).

### Exploitability

The Exploitability ranking is a score for the potential ability to exploit a crash based on 3 engines.  The ranks, ranging from High (4) to None (0), in order of likelyhood are:

  * **High** (4): The mostly likely case of a crash being exploitable.
  * **Medium** (3): Between High and Low.
  * **Low** (2): At or above the cutoff for low exploitability.
  * **Unknown** (1): Unknown cases are below the cutoff for low, but still have the potential to be of interest.
  * **None** (0): Very unlikely the crash is exploitable.

#### Engines

  * **Google's Breakpad**: This engine uses Google's Breakpad library, which parses minidump files and return an exploitability between High and None as well.
  * **Microsoft's `!exploitable`**: A reimplementation and approxmiation of the `!exploitable` command for `windbg`, built on top of breakpad.
  * **SL2 Tracer**: Uses the score from our own SL2 tracer, which takes taint information into consideration.

### triage.json

After the tracer has been run, `triager.exe` is run on the minidump file. It also loads any information generated by the tracer, and outputs the following json:

```c

    // This is the called functions before the crash

# Developer Information

If you change anything that would break backwards compatibility, increment
`harness.config.VERSION`.  Examples of breaking changes include changes to the database structure,
changes to various binary formats, directory structures, and so forth.
